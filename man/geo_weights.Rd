\title{Inverse Geographic Weight Matrix}
\usage{
geo_weights(coordinates, groups)
}
\arguments{
\item{coordinates}{matrix of coordinates of observations.}

\item{groups}{vector of neighborhood groups.}
}
\value{
Returns a weighting matrix \code{W} and the coordinates of the centers per neighborhood \code{centersN}.
}
\description{
Calculates a inverse-distance based weight matrix for the function \code{\link[ssMRCD]{ssMRCD}} (see details).
}
\details{
First, the centers (means of the coordinates given) \eqn{c_i} of each neighborhood is calculated.
Then, the Euclidean distance between the centers is calculated and the weight is based on
the inverse distance between two neighborhoods, \deqn{w_{ij} = \frac{1}{dist(c_i, c_j)}. }
It is scaled according to a weight matrix.

\examples{
coordinates = matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 2, nrow = 500)
groups = sample(1:5, 500, replace = TRUE)
